## About

Auxio is a local music player with a fast, reliable UI/UX without the many useless features present in other music players. Built off of <a href="https://exoplayer.dev/">Exoplayer</a>, Auxio has superior library support and listening quality compared to other apps that use outdated android functionality. In short, **It plays music.**

I primarily built Auxio for myself, but you can use it too, I guess.

**The default branch is the development version of the repository. For a stable version, see the master branch.**

## Building

Auxio relies on a custom version of ExoPlayer that enables some extra features. So, the build process is as follows:

1. `cd` into the project directory.
2. Run `python3 prebuild.py`, which installs ExoPlayer and it's extensions.
    - The pre-build process only works with \*nix systems. On windows, this process must be done manually.
3. Build the project normally in Android Studio.

## Contributing

Auxio accepts most contributions as long as they follow the [Contribution Guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

However, feature additions and major UI changes are less likely to be accepted. See [Accepted Additions](/info/ADDITIONS.md) for more information.
