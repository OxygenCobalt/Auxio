# AGENTS.md — Auxio-TS coding authority

## Project stance
- Auxio-TS is an Auxio fork; preserve upstream architecture.
- Keep TS18/TW integration in adapter/facade boundaries.
- Use `docs/evidence/t-music-snapshot/` as evidence only, not implementation source.

## TS18 claim labeling (required)
For TS18/TW/TWTHEME claims, include both labels:

- **Evidence confidence**: Observed / Inferred / Hypothesis / Requires TS18 validation / Unsupported
- **Porting decision**: Directly reusable requirement / Reusable validation idea / Useful as evidence only / Obsolete due to Auxio architecture / Requires TS18 runtime validation / Unsafe to port / Should be explicitly avoided

## Hard constraints
- Do not change package identity to `com.tw.music`.
- Do not require privileged/system UID or platform signing.
- Do not copy decompiled smali into app code.
- Do not spread TS18 conditionals through core playback/library code.
- Do not claim TS18 compatibility without runtime evidence.

## Validation baseline
Run or document blockers for:
- `./gradlew tasks`
- `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- `./gradlew test`
- `./gradlew lint`
- `find scripts -type f -name '*.sh' -print -exec sh -n {} \;`

## Release/signing safety
- Treat release/signing workflow edits as security-sensitive.
- Never print secrets or commit keystores/signing artifacts.
- Keep decoded keystores only in runner temp paths.
- Initialize submodules recursively before Gradle; do not create fake submodule files.
