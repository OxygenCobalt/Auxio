/**
 * A highly opinionated, multi-threaded device music library.
 *
 * Use this to load music with [run].
 *
 * Note the following:
 * 1. Musikr's API surface is intended to be primarily "stateless", with side-effects mostly
 *    contained within [Storage]. It's your job to manage long-term state.
 * 2. There are no "defaults" in Musikr. You should think carefully about the parameters you are
 *    specifying and know consider they are desirable or not.
 * 3. Musikr is currently not extendable, so if you're embedding this elsewhere you should be ready
 *    to fork and modify the source code.
