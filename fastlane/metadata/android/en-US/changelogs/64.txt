Auxio 4.0.0 completely overhauls the user experience, with a refreshed design based on the latest Material Design specs
and a brand new music loader with signifigant improvements to device and tag support.
This patch fixes slower music loading and re-adds folder exclusion. Deep apologies for how long this took to fix.
