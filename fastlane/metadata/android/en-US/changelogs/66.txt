Auxio 4.0.0 completely overhauls the user experience, with a refreshed design based on the latest Material Design specs
and a brand new music loader with signifigant improvements to device and tag support.
This patch reintroduces the faster, but less reliable pre-v4.0.0 music loader for use with large libraries,
enables full date added support, and fixes a variety of UI/UX issues.
