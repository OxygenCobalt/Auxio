Auxio 4.0.0 completely overhauls the user experience, with a refreshed design based on the latest Material Design specs
and a brand new music loader with signifigant improvements to device and tag support.
This patch fixes music loading failing/crashing on some devices and makes a caching system that prevented the music library from updating on some devices.
