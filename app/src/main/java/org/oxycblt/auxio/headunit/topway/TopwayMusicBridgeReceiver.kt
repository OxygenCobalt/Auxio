/**
 * Narrow exported bridge receiver for Topway-compatible actions when Auxio is cold.
 *
 * It is exported so TS18/iLauncher can deliver the source-backed Topway actions, but it accepts
 * only the allowlisted actions from [TopwayMusicContract] and immediately delegates to Auxio's
 * service-specific Topway path. It must never route through generic media-button restore logic.
