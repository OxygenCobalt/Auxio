/**
 * A utility to provide bitmaps in a race-less manner.
 *
 * When it comes to components that load images manually as [Bitmap] instances, queued
 * [ImageRequest]s may cause a race condition that results in the incorrect image being drawn. This
 * utility resolves this by keeping track of the current request, and disposing it as soon as a new
 * request is queued or if another, competing request is newer.
 *
