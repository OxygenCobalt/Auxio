/**
 * A heap-backed play queue.
 *
 * Whereas other queue implementations use a plain list, Auxio requires a more complicated data
 * structure in order to implement features such as gapless playback in ExoPlayer. This queue
 * implementation is instead based around an unorganized "heap" of [Song] instances, that are then
 * interpreted into different queues depending on the current playback configuration.
 *
 * In general, the implementation details don't need ot be known for this data structure to be used.
 * The functions exposed should be familiar for any typical play queue.
